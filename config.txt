# General config (in-repo)
# =================================
# SIMULATION mode:
# - SIMULATION=1 : ignore the real target time and use a simulated "midnight" (now + SIM_MIDNIGHT_AFTER_SECONDS)
# - SIMULATION=0 : use the real target time computed from TARGET_ISRAEL_TIME (Asia/Jerusalem)
SIMULATION=0

# Real target time (Israel local time, Asia/Jerusalem):
# This Israel clock time is treated as the "China midnight" reference moment.
# Default matches your earlier assumption: China midnight == 18:00 Israel time.
TARGET_ISRAEL_TIME=18:00

# Seconds-based simulation target:
# When SIMULATION=1, simulated "midnight" will be: now + SIM_MIDNIGHT_AFTER_SECONDS
